      <h2>ðŸ“¸ About Me</h2>
      <p>Iâ€™m a local high school media creator based in <strong>Fishers, Indiana</strong>, with four years of hands-on experience in photography and videography â€” especially in the world of sports. What began as a fun hobby quickly grew into a passion, and now, a serious career focus.</p>
      
      <p>Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the chance to stand on the sidelines of major sporting events and work face-to-face with some of the top high school athletes in the region. From high school gyms to prep school showcases, Iâ€™ve developed a fast, energetic style that captures the heart of the game.</p>

      <p>Iâ€™ve filmed at schools across the state, including <strong>Carmel, Mt. Vernon, New Castle, Noblesville, Fishers, Hamilton Southeastern</strong>, and the <strong>Fishers Event Center</strong>. Along the way, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of creating content for standout athletes like <strong>Carmelo Anthony</strong> and the <strong>Boozer twins</strong>.</p>

      <p>My work has been featured by organizations such as <strong>Prep Ball Stars</strong>, <strong>Southeastern Sports Network</strong>, and <strong>Indy LAX Central</strong>, and I continue to collaborate with local teams and media outlets. Whether itâ€™s a photo, a mixtape, or a full recap â€” I focus on capturing the energy, emotion, and story behind every moment.</p>

      <p>As a student-athlete myself, I bring a unique perspective behind the lens. I know what it feels like to give your all on the field or court, and I use that experience to create visuals that tell your story and help you relive your greatest moments.</p>

      <p><strong>This is just the beginning.</strong> Iâ€™m proud of what Iâ€™ve built so far, and Iâ€™m always looking ahead to the next opportunity to grow, improve, and create something special. I look forward to continuing to work alongside new and up-and-coming athletes.</p>
